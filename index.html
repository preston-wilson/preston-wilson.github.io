      <h2>Self Assessment</h2>
      <div class="self-assessment" style="overflow-y:scroll;">
        <p>
        My time at SNHU started tumultuously; I had just recently left BNSF Railway after being told that 
        I was going to be one of many individuals who were being laid off in 2017, so beginning this educational 
        journey was akin to hitting the reset button on life, especially with a wife and two children depending 
        on me. Undoubtedly, I was intimidated by the world of computer science. Although I had at least some exposure 
        to programming from my time in the United States Marine Corps, where I used Python to help parse through 
        thousands of lines of csv files, and as a hobbyist game developer using C#, I doubted whether or not I 
        would be able to code professionally. However, these fears slowly started to fade as I took my first few 
        programming classes at SNHU.</p>
	        <p>It was within these first few classes that I learned how coding is highly similar to learning a foreign 
        language, it takes time, patience, practice, and persistence to fully understand. Also, just like when 
        you are learning a new language, as you become more proficient you begin to make it your own. In keeping 
        with our foreign language analogy, once you know grammar and syntax, you can begin to formulate your own 
        sentences, paragraphs, and even books in the form of methods, classes, and projects in your respective 
        programming language. This is where everything clicked for me and I realized that not only would I be able 
        to program professionally, but I would also be pretty creative at it.</p>
            <p>Just like how writers often draw inspiration from other writers, I learned to draw inspiration from other 
        programmers and their experiences. This concept was further strengthened when I began my first job as a Junior 
        Software Developer for a small company called Torch.AI in Leawood, Kansas. Torch is a small company, there’s 
        less than 25 of us in total, and our two architects didn’t mind me shadowing them whenever possible while 
        attempting to pick their brains for every tidbit of information that I could. I got to not only learn more 
        advanced programming concepts, such as deploying applications to Kubernetes or containerization through Docker, 
        but I also learned about more fundamental concepts, such as community accepted naming conventions for MVC 
        controllers in C#. With these newfound programming abilities and hunger for further problem solving, I solely 
        took on the issue of creating mock data for a web application we created for a client. Luckily for me, since 
        the logic that I used to generate the data was solely mine, my supervisors had absolutely no qualms about me 
        sharing it.</p>
            <p>Creating the mock data for app.moneypeer.com (the web application we created) was the basis for my final 
        project but getting to the point where I am at now took quite a bit of communication, experimentation, and 
        persistence. For instance, our client initially wanted me to mimic the employment statistics of the actual 
        population, but this left quite a few holes in the mock data since there are very few actual individuals within 
        the farming, fishing, and forestry occupations (only about 2 per 1,000 employees). This means that if I were to 
        generate mock data that followed the same distribution as the actual population, then I would need far more 
        generated data to account for individuals in sparsely worked occupations. So, instead of mimicking our labor 
        statistics, we decided to create data to account for each of the possible combinations of marital status, 
        occupation, salary range, age range, state, education range, and gender.</p>
            <p>In addition to smoothing over details like I’ve mentioned above, I also learned to leverage the wealth of 
        knowledge that our client had in his respective field of expertise, finance. While our client was unable to 
        tell the difference between frontend and backend development, he possessed a vast array of knowledge detailing 
        how individuals manage their money, which helped me to enhance the control structures that I used for my data 
        generation. Being able to identify areas to locate valuable information relevant to what you’re working on has 
        proven to be a crucial part of my learning and employment as a software engineer.</p>
